# Personal Portfolio

## About the project

Web portfolio using the technologies of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS), [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the frontend layer.

The web app features registration and login systems that provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for the data displayed in the main portfolio template.

### Important Note!

The backend deployment is done on the [Render](https://render.com/) service using a **free** instance of the Web Service. Due to this, after 15 minutes of inactivity, the service goes to sleep, and the first request made after this time may take a couple of minutes to respond. However, once the API service is active, all subsequent calls are carried out smoothly.
