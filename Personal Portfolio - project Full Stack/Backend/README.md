# Personal Portfolio (Backend)

APIRest built with Java Spring Boot using JPA Hibernate as the ORM and MySQL as the database engine.

## About the project

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a web portfolio using the technologies of [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the frontend layer, as well as [Java Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for the backend layer.

The web app features registration and login systems that provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for the data displayed in the main portfolio template.

Built in conjunction with a database connection and technologies such as [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) and [JPA Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/6.1/), the Spring Boot application follows standard layering and implementation practices commonly used in the industry, including:

- **Controllers**
- **Entities/Models**
- **Repositories**
- **Services**
- **DAO and DTO**

It also includes authentication and authorization using **JWT** (Json Web Token).
